        <h1>The Elevator</h1>
        <p>The weather was unseasonably cold for mid-July, and the oppressive silence in the towering concrete high-rise only made the night feel heavier. Jacob, 17, had just started his job as a night janitor in the abandoned office complex. His older brother, Nathan, had insisted he take it to save for college.</p>

        <p>“Easy work,” Nathan had said. “Just sweep, clean, and stay out of trouble. The building’s practically empty after 8.”</p>

        <p>But Jacob didn’t like the building. There was something off about it—the way the walls seemed to hum even when it was silent, the flicker of the lights, and the unsettling rumors among the day staff about "things" moving in the shadows.</p>

        <p>Tonight was his third shift.</p>

        <p>At 11:50 p.m., Jacob stood in the lobby with his cleaning cart, debating whether he should take the elevator or the stairs to finish the top floors. He stared at the old, industrial elevator. The brushed metal doors gleamed faintly under the flickering fluorescents.</p>

        <p>“Elevator it is,” he muttered, pushing the cart inside.</p>

        <p>The doors clanged shut behind him, and he pressed the button for the 15th floor. The ride began smoothly, the low hum of the motor vibrating through the cabin.</p>

        <p>Then, the elevator jerked violently and stopped between the 7th and 8th floors.</p>

        <p>“Great,” Jacob groaned, pressing the emergency button. Nothing happened. The fluorescent lights in the cabin flickered before dimming to an ominous glow. He pulled out his phone to call for help. No signal.</p>

        <p>“Of course,” he muttered.</p>

        <p>As he leaned against the wall, deciding whether to climb through the emergency hatch, he noticed something strange. The floor indicator, frozen at “7,” began to glitch. It blinked erratically before displaying an unfamiliar symbol: <strong>∞</strong>.</p>

        <p>Jacob frowned. “What the—”</p>

        <p>A loud metallic screech echoed through the shaft, followed by a sound that made his stomach churn: something heavy crawling on top of the elevator.</p>

        <p>“Hello?” he called, his voice shaky.</p>

        <p>No response, just the rhythmic thud of something dragging itself across the roof.</p>

        <p>The emergency hatch rattled violently, and Jacob backed into the corner, clutching his mop like a weapon. The hatch burst open, and a long, clawed hand—pale and skeletal—reached down, groping blindly.</p>

        <p>Jacob screamed, swinging the mop at the hand. The creature hissed, its voice like nails on glass. The hand retreated, and the hatch slammed shut.</p>

        <p>The lights flickered again, plunging the cabin into darkness.</p>

        <p>Jacob fumbled for his flashlight, his hands shaking. When he turned it on, he gasped.</p>

        <p>The walls of the elevator were no longer metal. They were covered in pulsating flesh, veins crawling like worms under the surface. Blood dripped from the ceiling, pooling at his feet.</p>

        <p>A voice echoed through the cabin, deep and distorted, like a recording played backward.</p>

        <p>“Do you know where you are?”</p>

        <p>Jacob’s flashlight flickered, revealing shapes writhing beneath the fleshy walls—faces, mouths silently screaming, hands pressing against the surface as if trying to escape.</p>

        <p>“No, no, no,” Jacob whispered, banging on the elevator doors. “Let me out!”</p>

        <p>The voice spoke again, this time clearer. “You are between worlds. You called, and we answered.”</p>

        <p>“I didn’t call anyone!” Jacob shouted, tears streaming down his face.</p>

        <p>The elevator jolted downward, faster than any normal descent. The walls vibrated violently, and the voices of the trapped souls grew louder, their screams overlapping into a deafening cacophony.</p>

        <p>When the elevator finally stopped, the doors creaked open.</p>

        <p>Jacob hesitated, the air thick with the stench of decay. He shone his flashlight outside and saw what looked like a hospital corridor, but it was wrong. The walls were covered in rust and dried blood, and the flickering lights cast distorted shadows that didn’t match their sources.</p>

        <p>“Get back in,” a voice whispered behind him.</p>

        <p>He spun around, but the elevator was empty.</p>

        <p>A shadow moved at the end of the hallway, impossibly tall and thin, its limbs bending at unnatural angles. Jacob froze as it turned to face him, its eyeless face splitting into a wide, toothless grin.</p>

        <p>It pointed at him.</p>

        <p>Jacob bolted down the hallway, his shoes slipping on the slick, blood-streaked floor. The corridor seemed endless, twisting and turning, doors lining the walls. From behind each door, he heard scratching, banging, and faint voices calling his name.</p>

        <p>“Jacob… Jacob… help us…”</p>

        <p>He stopped at a door that was slightly ajar, a faint light spilling through the crack. Against his better judgment, he pushed it open.</p>

        <p>Inside was a small, dimly lit room with a single chair in the center. On the chair sat a child, no older than ten, wearing a tattered hospital gown. The child’s head was lowered, his face obscured by stringy black hair.</p>

        <p>“Are you okay?” Jacob asked, stepping closer.</p>

        <p>The child’s head snapped up, revealing hollow eye sockets and a mouth sewn shut with thick black thread. Jacob stumbled backward, tripping over something soft.</p>

        <p>When he looked down, he saw it was his cleaning cart—but it was covered in blood, and the mop handle had transformed into a twisted, gnarled bone.</p>

        <p>The child stood, its head twisting unnaturally as it watched him. Then it opened its sewn mouth, the threads snapping, and it let out a piercing scream.</p>

        <p>The hallway behind him erupted in chaos. Doors flew open, and shadowy figures spilled out, their distorted faces contorted in agony.</p>

        <p>Jacob ran, his lungs burning, but no matter how far he ran, the elevator doors never came into sight.</p>

        <p>The lights above flickered and went out entirely. The world was black now, the only sounds his ragged breaths and the growing noise of footsteps behind him.</p>

        <p>Then, he heard it.</p>

        <p>A voice whispered, inches from his ear: “It’s your turn.”</p>

        <p>Something cold and sharp pierced his back, and he collapsed, the pain searing. He felt himself being dragged, but he was too weak to fight.</p>

        <p>When he opened his eyes, he was inside the elevator again, but it wasn’t the same. The walls were flesh, the floor was wet with blood, and the distorted faces stared at him from the walls.</p>

        <p>He tried to scream, but his voice was gone.</p>

        <p>The elevator chimed softly as the floor indicator displayed one word: <strong>HELL</strong>.</p>

        <p>When the maintenance crew found the elevator the next morning, it was empty. The walls were scratched with the words:</p>

        <p><strong>“DO NOT ENTER. THEY ARE WAITING.”</strong></p>

        <p>No one ever used that elevator again. But late at night, passersby swear they can hear it running, the faint sound of screams echoing from within.</p>
